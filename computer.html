          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            Computer is an electronic device derived from the Latin word
            "computere," which means to calculate. It processes input, stores
            it, and produces meaningful output through an output device,
            following the Input-Process-Output (IPO) cycle. Computers rely on
            the principle of GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out), emphasizing that
            the output is only as good as the input.
